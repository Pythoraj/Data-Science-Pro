        "**Here's a common implementation using a class attribute:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "    def __new__(cls):\n",

        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Attribute:** The `_instance` attribute is a class attribute that holds the reference to the single instance of the class.\n",
        "2. **`__new__` Method:** The `__new__` method is a special method that is called before `__init__`. It checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it in the `_instance` attribute. If an instance already exists, it returns the existing instance.\n",
        "3. **`__init__` Method:** The `__init__` method is the regular constructor, which is called only once when the first instance is created.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The Singleton pattern is a design pattern, not a language feature.\n",
        "- The implementation can vary slightly depending on specific requirements and use cases.\n",

        "A child class can define its own `__init__()` method to add or modify the initialization process. However, if the child class still needs the initialization defined in the parent class, it should explicitly call the parent's `__init__()` method using `super()`.\n",

        "Getter and setter methods are essential concepts in encapsulation, a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This is typically achieved by making attributes private and controlling access to them through getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of Getter and Setter Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding**:\n",
        "   - Getter and setter methods allow you to control how the attributes of a class are accessed or modified. By using these methods, you can hide the internal representation of the data and only expose what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Validation and Control**:\n",
        "   - Setters can include validation logic to ensure that the data being set meets certain criteria before it's assigned to an attribute. This helps maintain the integrity of the data.\n",
        "   - Getters can be used to control how data is accessed or to compute values dynamically when requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Read-Only or Write-Only Access**:\n",
        "   - By using only a getter or a setter, you can make an attribute read-only (accessible but not modifiable) or write-only (modifiable but not accessible).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Flexibility**:\n",
        "   - If the internal implementation of an attribute changes, you can update the getter and setter methods without affecting the external code that interacts with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):\n",
        "        self.owner = owner\n",
        "        self._balance = balance  # Private attribute (by convention)\n",

        "    # Setter for balance\n",
        "    @balance.setter\n",
        "    def balance(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount < 0:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Balance cannot be negative.\")\n",
        "        self._balance = amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Method to deposit money\n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > 0:\n",
        "            self._balance += amount\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Method to withdraw money\n",
        "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
        "        if 0 < amount <= self._balance:\n",
        "            self._balance -= amount\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Usage\n",
        "account = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 100)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Accessing the balance using the getter\n",
        "print(account.balance)  # Outputs: 100\n",
        "\n",
        "# Depositing money\n",
        "account.deposit(50)\n",
        "print(account.balance)  # Outputs: 150\n",
        "\n",
        "# Attempting to set a negative balance using the setter (will raise an error)\n",
        "# account.balance = -100  # Raises: ValueError: Balance cannot be negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Withdrawing money\n",
        "account.withdraw(70)\n",
        "print(account.balance)  # Outputs: 80\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Private Attribute**:\n",
        "   - The `_balance` attribute is considered private (denoted by the single underscore `_`), meaning it should not be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Getter (`@property`)**:\n",
        "   - The `balance()` method is decorated with `@property`, making it a getter method. This allows you to access the `_balance` attribute via `account.balance` without directly accessing the private attribute. The getter provides controlled access to the attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Setter (`@balance.setter`)**:\n",
        "   - The `balance()` method with the `@balance.setter` decorator allows you to modify the `_balance` attribute via `account.balance = amount`. The setter includes validation logic to ensure the balance cannot be set to a negative value.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Deposit and Withdraw Methods**:\n",
        "   - These methods provide a controlled way to modify the balance while ensuring that the operations are valid. The balance cannot be directly changed without going through the validation logic in these methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: The internal state (`_balance`) is protected, and any modifications must go through controlled methods.\n",
        "- **Data Integrity**: The setter ensures that the balance cannot be set to an invalid value.\n",
        "- **Ease of Maintenance**: If the internal logic or representation of the balance needs to change, you can modify the getter and setter methods without affecting external code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Getter and setter methods are integral to encapsulation in OOP. They allow you to control access to an object's attributes, enforce validation, and maintain data integrity while providing flexibility in how attributes are managed and accessed."

        "Name mangling is a technique in Python that automatically adds a leading double underscore (`__`) to the names of private attributes and methods within a class. This helps to prevent accidental access or modification of these members from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- When a name starts with two underscores (`__`), Python automatically adds the class name and a leading underscore to the name.\n",
        "- This makes the name unique to the class and prevents it from being accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",

        "        return self.__private_attribute\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `__private_attribute` attribute will be mangled to `_MyClass__private_attribute`. This makes it difficult (but not impossible) to access directly from outside the `MyClass` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact on Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Name mangling helps to improve encapsulation by making it more difficult to accidentally access or modify private members.

        "Property decorators in Python provide a mechanism to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, facilitating a more controlled and encapsulated approach to managing an object's attributes. This concept is closely tied to the principle of encapsulation, which is fundamental in object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Property Decorators in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides three primary property decorators:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`@property`**: Used to define a getter method that allows you to access an attribute.\n",
        "2. **`@<property_name>.setter`**: Used to define a setter method that allows you to set or modify an attribute.\n",
        "3. **`@<property_name>.deleter`**: Used to define a deleter method that allows you to delete an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Property Decorators Relate to Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control Over Attribute Access**:\n",
        "   - Property decorators allow you to control how attributes are accessed and modified. This ensures that attributes are only accessed or modified in the ways that you define, which is a core aspect of encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Hiding and Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - By using property decorators, you can hide the internal implementation details of an attribute. For example, you can change the way an attribute is calculated or stored without changing the interface that external code uses to interact with that attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Validation**:\n",
        "   - Setters allow you to add validation logic when setting an attribute's value, ensuring that the object remains in a valid state. This encapsulates the logic for maintaining data integrity within the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Read-Only or Write-Only Attributes**:\n",
        "   - By defining only a getter without a setter, you can create read-only attributes that can be accessed but not modified. Conversely, defining only a setter can create write-only attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Property Decorators\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "  - The `_width` and `_height` attributes are private (indicated by the leading underscore) and are not meant to be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "  - The `width` and `height` properties are used to access these attributes. The setters ensure that only valid values can be assigned, protecting the integrity of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Abstraction**:\n",
        "  - The `area` property is a computed attribute that is derived from `width` and `height`. The user of the class doesn't need to know how the area is calculated; they just access it as if it were a regular attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Read-Only Property**:\n",
        "  - The `area` property is read-only because it only has a getter. This ensures that it cannot be accidentally modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Property decorators in Python provide a way to encapsulate the access to an object's attributes, offering a controlled interface for getting, setting, and deleting attributes. They help maintain the integrity of the object's state by allowing you to add validation logic, hide internal implementation details, and enforce read-only or write-only access. This makes your code more robust, flexible, and easier to maintain, all while adhering to the principles of encapsulation in OOP."

        "Accessors and mutators, commonly known as **getter** and **setter** methods, are integral to the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (a class), while controlling access to the internal state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accessors (Getters) and Mutators (Setters)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Accessor (Getter)**:\n",
        "  - An accessor, or getter, is a method that retrieves or \"gets\" the value of an attribute. It allows read-only access to the attribute, meaning that external code can view the value of the attribute but cannot modify it directly.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Mutator (Setter)**:\n",
        "  - A mutator, or setter, is a method that updates or \"sets\" the value of an attribute. It allows controlled modification of the attribute, often including validation logic to ensure that any changes made to the attribute are valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Accessors and Mutators Support Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Control Over Attribute Access**:\n",
        "   - By using accessors and mutators, you can control how attributes of a class are accessed and modified. This prevents external code from directly accessing or altering the internal state of an object, thus safeguarding the integrity of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Validation**:\n",
        "   - Mutators (setters) provide a place to implement validation logic. For example, if an attribute should only accept positive numbers, the setter can enforce this rule. Without setters, external code could potentially set invalid values directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Accessors and mutators allow you to hide the internal implementation details of an attribute. The attribute's internal representation can be changed without affecting how external code interacts with it, as long as the accessors and mutators remain consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Read-Only and Write-Only Attributes**:\n",
        "   - Accessors (without corresponding mutators) can create read-only attributes, ensuring that external code can view the attribute's value but cannot change it.\n",
        "   - Mutators (without corresponding accessors) can create write-only attributes, where external code can set the value but cannot directly retrieve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Maintaining Object Integrity**:\n",
        "   - By centralizing the access and modification of attributes within accessors and mutators, you ensure that any changes to an object's state happen in a controlled and predictable manner. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the object's state.\n",

        "\n",
        "Accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) are key tools in enforcing encapsulation in OOP. They help maintain control over how attributes of a class are accessed and modified, ensuring that an object's internal state remains consistent and valid.

        "Information hiding is a fundamental concept in encapsulation that involves concealing the internal details of an object's implementation from the outside world. The primary goal of information hiding is to protect an object's internal state and implementation details from being accessed or modified directly by external code. Instead, interactions with the object are mediated through a well-defined interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Concept of Information Hiding\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Internal State Concealment**:\n",
        "   - Information hiding ensures that the internal attributes and methods of an object are not exposed to external code. This is achieved by using access controls such as private or protected attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Public Interface**:\n",
        "   - The object provides a public interface, usually through public methods or properties, which external code uses to interact with the object. This interface is carefully designed to expose only the necessary functionalities while hiding the complexities of the internal implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Controlled Access**:\n",
        "   - Access to the internal state is controlled via getter and setter methods (accessors and mutators). This allows you to enforce rules and validation when accessing or modifying the internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Information hiding supports abstraction by allowing you to define what an object does without specifying how it does it. This abstraction simplifies the interaction with the object, as users of the object do not need to understand its internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of Information Hiding in Software Development\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduced Complexity**:\n",
        "   - By hiding implementation details, you reduce the complexity of interacting with an object. Users of the object only need to understand the public interface, making the object easier to use and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enhanced Maintainability**:\n",
        "   - Information hiding allows you to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting the external code that relies on it. This means you can make improvements or fixes to the internal logic without risking breakages in other parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improved Security**:\n",
        "   - Hiding internal data helps protect the integrity and security of the object's state. External code cannot directly modify or access sensitive data, reducing the risk of unintended modifications or security vulnerabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Encapsulation and Modularity**:\n",
        "   - Information hiding is a key aspect of encapsulation and modularity. It helps in creating self-contained modules with well-defined interfaces, which can be developed, tested, and debugged independently. This modular approach contributes to a more organized and maintainable codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ease of Refactoring**:\n",
        "   - With information hiding, you can refactor the internal implementation of a class without impacting the classes or modules that use it. This flexibility is essential for evolving software and improving code quality over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Reduced Coupling**:\n",
        "   - Information hiding reduces the coupling between different parts of a system. By exposing only what is necessary through a public interface, you minimize the dependencies between components, making it easier to manage and evolve the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Information Hiding\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):\n",
        "        self._account_number = account_number\n",
        "        self._balance = balance\n",

        "# print(account._balance)  # Should be avoided\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Internal State Concealment**:\n",
        "  - The `_balance` attribute is private (by convention) and is not directly accessible from outside the class. The underscore indicates that it is intended for internal use only.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Public Interface**:\n",
        "  - The `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance` methods provide a controlled way to interact with the `BankAccount` object. External code interacts with these methods without needing to know the details of how the balance is managed internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Controlled Access**:\n",
        "  - The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods include validation to ensure that only valid operations are performed on the balance. This helps maintain the integrity of the object’s state.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Information hiding in encapsulation is crucial for managing complexity, ensuring security, and maintaining the integrity of an object's internal state. By concealing implementation details and providing a controlled public interface, information hiding simplifies the use of objects, enhances maintainability, and supports modular and secure software design. It allows developers to make changes to an object's internal workings without affecting the broader system, leading to more robust and flexible software."

In Python, polymorphism can be categorized into two types: **compile-time polymorphism** and **runtime polymorphism**.

        "\n",
        "2. **Method Resolution**:\n",

        "In summary, compile-time polymorphism involves method resolution during compile time, often through method or function overloading, and is more relevant in statically typed languages. Runtime polymorphism involves method resolution during runtime through method overriding and is a core feature in dynamically typed languages like Python.

        "**Code Reusability:**\n",

        "- **Generic Functions:** Polymorphism allows you to write generic functions that can work with objects of different types. This reduces code duplication and promotes reusability.\n",
        "- **Shared Behavior:** By defining a common interface (e.g., using abstract base classes), you can create functions that operate on objects of different classes that share that interface. This enables you to reuse code without having to write separate implementations for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flexibility:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dynamic Behavior:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can adapt to different object types at runtime. This makes your code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.\n",
        "- **Extensibility:** Polymorphism makes it easier to extend your codebase by adding new classes that implement the same interface. This promotes modularity and maintainability.\n",
        "- **Simplified Design:** Polymorphism can simplify the design of your code by allowing you to focus on the common behavior of objects rather than their specific types.\n",

        "Encapsulation and abstraction are closely related concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulation involves bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, while abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object, hiding the unnecessary details.\n",

        "**Significance of Encapsulation in Achieving Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Information Hiding:** Encapsulation helps to hide the internal implementation details of an object, making it easier to focus on its essential features. This is a key aspect of abstraction, as it allows you to treat objects as black boxes that provide specific functionality without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
        "2. **Controlled Access:** Encapsulation provides controlled access to an object's data and methods through a well-defined interface. This prevents unauthorized access or modification, ensuring the integrity of the object's state.\n",
        "3. **Modularity:** Encapsulated objects can be treated as self-contained units, making it easier to reuse them in different parts of your code. This promotes modularity and reduces code complexity.\n",

        "**Key Aspects of Method Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Common Interface:** Define a common interface for a group of methods, specifying their names, parameters, and return types.\n",
        "- **Implementation Details:** Hide the specific implementation details of the methods, allowing for flexibility and customization.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** Method abstraction is closely related to polymorphism. By defining a common interface, you can create functions that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they implement the required methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def make_sound(self):\n",

        "**Benefits of Method Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** Method abstraction enables polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class.\n",

        "\n",
        "While inheritance can be a powerful tool, composition often offers greater flexibility and reusability in Python. Here are some key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flexibility:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Dynamic Composition:** You can change the components of a class dynamically, allowing for more flexible and adaptable designs. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the relationships between classes might change over time.\n",
        "* **Avoidance of Tight Coupling:** Composition promotes loose coupling between classes, meaning changes to one class are less likely to affect other classes. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to modify.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reusability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Smaller, More Reusable Components:** Composition encourages you to break down complex objects into smaller, more focused components. These components can often be reused in different parts of your application or even in other projects.\n",
        "* **Avoidance of Inheritance Hierarchies:** Overreliance on inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies that can be difficult to understand and maintain. Composition provides a more flexible alternative, allowing you to build complex objects without creating deep inheritance chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Engine:\n",
        "    # ...\n",
        "\n",
        "class Wheels:\n",
        "    # ...\n",
        "\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.engine = Engine()\n",
        "        self.wheels = Wheels()\n",
        "\n",
        "    # ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `Car` class uses composition to include an `Engine` and `Wheels` object. This allows for more flexibility, as you can easily change the type of engine or wheels used in the `Car` without modifying the `Car` class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Composition** offers greater flexibility and reusability compared to inheritance.\n",
        "* **Dynamic Composition:** Allows you to change components at runtime.\n",
        "* **Loose Coupling:** Reduces the impact of changes to individual components.\n",
        "* **Smaller, More Reusable Components:** Encourages the creation of smaller, more focused components.\n",
        "* **Avoidance of Inheritance Hierarchies:** Provides a more flexible alternative to deep inheritance chains.\n"

        "**Code Maintainability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Separation of Concerns:** Composition breaks down complex systems into smaller, more focused components, making it easier to understand and maintain each part independently.\n",
        "- **Isolation of Changes:** Changes to one component are less likely to affect other parts of the system, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
        "- **Easier Debugging:** Composition can make it easier to debug and fix issues, as you can focus on specific components and their interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modularity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reusable Components:** Composition encourages the creation of smaller, more reusable components that can be used in different parts of your application or even in other projects.\n",
        "- **Flexibility:** Composition provides flexibility by allowing you to change the components of a class without affecting its overall interface. This makes it easier to adapt your code to changing requirements.\n",
        "- **Extensibility:** Composition makes it easier to extend your code by adding new components or modifying existing ones.\n",
