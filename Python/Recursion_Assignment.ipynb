        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `towerOfHanoi` function takes the number of disks (n), the source rod, the destination rod, and the auxiliary rod as input.\n",
        "- The base case checks if there is only one disk. If so, it moves it directly.\n",

        "    - It recursively moves n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary rod using the destination as the intermediate.\n",
        "    - It moves the largest disk (n-th disk) from the source to the destination.\n",
        "    - It recursively moves n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the destination using the source as the intermediate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How Recursion Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `towerOfHanoi` function calls itself recursively with smaller values of n until the base case is reached. The recursive calls build up a stack of function calls, and each call returns after completing its subproblem. This allows the algorithm to efficiently solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disk Movements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of the program will show the sequence of disk movements. For example, for 3 disks:\n",
        "\n",

        "Move disk 1 from A to C\n",

        "   - We take the minimum of these three values and store it in the current cell of the `dp` table.\n",
